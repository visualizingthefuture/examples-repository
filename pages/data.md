We strive to make our collections findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. I plan to turn this page into a one-stop shop for datasets and data visualizations hosted by this repository.

This demo site comes with a specific `_include` called `interactive_metadata_table` to help you make pages like this one complete with interactive [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and downloadable CSVs of collection metadata.

{% include interactive_metadata_table.html collection=page.collection %}
