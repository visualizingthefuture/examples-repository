## Summary    
The Teach Viz by Example repository is a space for the data visualization teaching community to find, share, and contribute exemplary data visualizations + visualization-ready datasets. The beta version of this website comprises a set of sample data visualization and data set objects, including related images and metadata. The collection items in this demo were suggested by the [Visualizing the Future](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/) fellows and organizers.

## Browse
After navigating to the "Browse" drop-down in the menu, you can select to browse either the visualization collection or the dataset collection. Each collection has slightly different properties. For example, on the visualization Browse page, you can see thumbnail images of the visualization examples.<!--[^1]-->

The "Browse" pages include facets on select metadata fields. The facets, or checkbox filters, appear on the left and allow users to specify which combination of example properties is desirable. Selecting an option in one of the facet groups will filter the examples to include only those examples tagged with that value. For example, if you are looking for examples at a "beginner" audience level, clicking the "beginner" checkbox will exclude anything not tagged for beginners. If you are okay with either beginner or intermediate examples, you can select both boxes at the same time. That will include items with **either** a beginner tag or an intermediate tag (or both).<!--[^2]-->

If you choose checkboxes from more than one facet group, your search will become more refined. For example, if you start with beginner and intermediate examples, but then you also select "entertainment" as the topic area, your search will change from all beginner/intermediate examples to only those that also are tagged as "entertainment." Feel free to play with the filter options to get used to how they work!

## Search
The "Search" link in the menu will take you to a search box that will search across various metadata fields for both data visualization and dataset examples. This is most useful if you know the name of the data set or visualization you are searching for, or some other qualifying information. A few examples include searching by title, creator, or topic (i.e., gun violence).
