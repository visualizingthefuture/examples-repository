This site's sample collection comprises a set of objects, each of which is represented by one or more images. The collection items in this demo are provided by the [Clark Data Labs](https://clarkdatalabs.github.io/) at the University of Michigan and the [Visualizing the Future](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io//) Fellowship community.
