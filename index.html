<p style="font-size:18px" ><strong>What does a design process look like that acknowledges, from the beginning, 
   that all digital platforms are ephemeral?</strong> What is the core conceptual labor at
   work in a digital repository, how might anticipating the broader lifespan of those ideas 
   and labor help guide a development process? This case study follows the development of 
   a repository of exemplary data visualization resources for library-based instruction.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px" ><strong>Visualizing the Future</strong> is an 
    <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/available/national-leadership-grants-libraries">IMLS 
      National Forum</a> grant project to develop a literacy-based instructional and research 
      agenda for library and information professionals with the aim to create a community of 
      praxis focused on data visualization. As part of the National Forum, 
      <a href="https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/fellows/">several fellows</a> began 
      working on building resources to support librarians in developing data visualization 
      pedagogy. The Examples working group elected to develop a digital repository to host 
      exemplary data visualizations and datasets for instructor use across a variety of contexts.</p>
