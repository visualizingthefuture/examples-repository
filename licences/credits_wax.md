Wax is a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led by [Marii Nyröp](http://marii.info/). The project is currently maintained by Marii Nyröp and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex) at Columbia University Libraries. It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/). Wax builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others.

Additional functionality that drives this site has been added by members of the [Visualizing the Future](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/) Examples Repository project team, including [Amanda West](https://amawest.github.io/#About), [Cass Wilkinson Saldaña](https://github.com/zoews), [Angela Zoss](https://github.com/amzoss), and [Jo Klein](https://github.com/ejklein).
