  A visualization of casualties of the Iraq war. From the creator: "This graphic was created to mark the end of the United States' military engagement in Iraq in 2011. Over 4,800 coalition soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis lost their lives in the war.

  One deliberate design choice with this graphic was the visual metaphor of blood. This striking visual would hopefully draw the reader into the graphic."
ethical_quandries: 'Questions about representation (e.g. who is represented and who
  is not represented?). Issues of spatial aggregation in the map (How do casualty
  count port to troop population size? Can we know if one area was more dangerous
  than another?) '
