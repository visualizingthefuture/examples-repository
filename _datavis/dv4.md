description: 'A visualization of casualties of the Iraq war. From the creator: "This
  graphic was created to mark the end of the United States'' military engagement in
  Iraq in 2011. Over 4,800 coalition soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis lost
  their lives in the war. One deliberate design choice with this graphic was the visual
  metaphor of blood. This striking visual would hopefully draw the reader into the
  graphic."'
