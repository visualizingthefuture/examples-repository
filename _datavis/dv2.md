pedagogical_description: Demonstrates the power of visual encoding to make the visualization
  harder to interpret. The creator tried to use the metaphor of dripping blood and
  flipped the y-axis but it's easier to see the rise in gun deaths when the y-axis
  is in the more traditional direction. Flipped version of the chart is later in the
  article.
