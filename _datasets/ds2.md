pedagogical_description: Larger dataset, visualization of this dataset can reinforce
  previous knowledge, particularly it reflects the difference the introduction of
  the vaccine had on the population and news stories of smaller outbreaks happening
  in the early 1990s. There is also missing data for some states. One noticeable omission
  is data from New York after 1960.
