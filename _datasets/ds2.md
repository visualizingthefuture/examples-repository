description: Measles cases reported in the United States from 1888-2002.
data_domain: health
original_context: scholarly research
audience_level: Adult beginner (high school and older), Intermediate
audience_composition: General
pedagogical_description: Larger dataset, visualization of this dataset can reinforce
  previous knowledge, particularly it reflects the difference the introduction of
  the vaccine had on the population and news stories of smaller outbreaks happening
  in the early 1990s. There is also missing data for some states. One noticeable omission
  is data from New York after 1960.
data_processing: Follows the Project Tycho Standard Data Format
data_type: 1 or more categorical variables, 1 or more numerical variables, 1 or more
  date/time variables, 1 or more geospatial variables
geospatial_std: ISO 3166 for country name and code and administrative subdivision
  name and code, second order administrative division and city names from Geonames
addl_data_props: Missing data from certain states for certain time periods. The data
  has both cumulative and non-cumulative counts for different years. Some states have
  both for the same year. Interoperable with other project tycho datasets. Does not
  take into account the population of each state at the time so good to match with
  population data to get rates. Must log in to retreive data.
