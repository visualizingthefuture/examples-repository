description: Active/current pet licenses issued in the city of Seattle, WA.
data_domain: government
original_context: just for fun
audience_level: Young beginner (pre-high school), Adult beginner (high school and
  older)
audience_composition: General
pedagogical_description: 1. Discussion about how the License Number is a unique identifier,
  not a numerical value that can be measured. 2. There is a major drop in active licenses
  the further back in time you go (presumably the pets died or moved away), so can
  have discussion about being clear about language (active licenses issued vs all
  licenses ever issued). 3. Potentially narrowing down to zip code of where someone
  lives if you know they're in the Seattle area and know their pet's name -- conversation
  about privacy, being identified in data, etc.
